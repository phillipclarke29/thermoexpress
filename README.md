##Project to design a working thermostat using Javascript, jquery, express and mongo.

### User Story

As a user I want to be able to set the temperature of my house wherever I am.

As user I want to be able to turn on a power saving mode to save money

###  Getting Started

Run the server using node app.js at root - thermostat is at localhost:3000

Jasmine tests can be run from the command line at root using open SpecRunner.html



###  Design

This is based on Makers Academy Thermostat but updated to use an express server and mongdb to persisted the thermostat state.  Overkill I know but it should be fun.  Maybe a bit of angular for good measure.

I am not planning to have an actually thermostat at the other end but I might take a look at the byzantium system I have at home to see if I can Babb something together.

### Usage

Hopefully to to site and set temp.
